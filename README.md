# GripCalculator

A simple Android app for quickly calculating grip strength as measured by an occupational or 
physical therapist using a Dynamometer. It takes three measurements from both hands and takes
an average of the three. It provides one average per hand. I created this app because it would
have saved me time as a clinician to be able to enter this information as I received it from
the patient and automatically get an average grip for documention.
